class Secret:
    """Manages read & write operations for files that contain sensitive encrypted data.

    Each instance of this class represents a unique string containing secret information
    that must be encrypted before saving it to a file, and subsequently decrypted before
    it can be accessed again.

    ??? question "FAQ - How does the encryption work?"
        <div id="key-files"/>
        This class uses [Fernet][1] symmetric encryption from the [`cryptography`][2]
        package to encrypt and decrypt data, optionally with extra protection in the
        form of a [password](./#passwords). The encrypted data is guaranteed to be
        unreadable without the original **key** that was used to encrypt it.
        Fernet keys are uniquely and randomly generated for each individual secret
        at encryption time.

        A secret is therefore represented in the file system by two separate `.key`
        files, both of which are named using the secret's `uid` (unique ID).
        One of the files contains the encrypted `content` of the secret, and the other
        file contains the `fernet` key required to decrypt it. Each of these files is
        useless without the other. :closed_lock_with_key:

    ??? info "Info - Fernet encryption with passwords"
        <div id="passwords"/>
        Factoring a password into the encryption of a secret can add an extra layer of
        protection because the password will not be stored anywhere on the file system.
        This means that even if a malicious actor were to gain access to both the
        `content.key` and `fernet.key` files of a secret, they still would not be able
        to decipher the original data.

        If a password is provided when a secret's
        [`write()`][botstrap.internal.Secret.write] method is invoked, the data will be
        encrypted using an algorithm based on [this][3] reference implementation. The
        password will be run through the [`PBKDF2HMAC`][4] key derivation function to
        obtain the Fernet key for the secret. As a result, the original password will
        have to be accurately entered in order to "complete" the key **every time** the
        secret is decrypted.
