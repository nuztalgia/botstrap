    **Note:** The contents of this package may not be as thoroughly
    documented as the public API and are subject to change at any time. They're
    included here for the sake of information-sharing and transparency, but
    probably won't be very helpful unless you're specifically curious about
    Botstrap's inner workings.

    If you're just trying to integrate Botstrap into your Discord bot, the
    info you need is in the [public API reference](../api).
