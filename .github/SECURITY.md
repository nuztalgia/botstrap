## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you might have found a security vulnerability, **please report it** so that
it can be fixed ASAP.

Depending on the severity of the problem, you can report it by doing one (or both) of
the following things:

- Contact the repository owner privately by sending an email to nuztalgia@gmail.com
- Create a public
  [bug report](https://github.com/nuztalgia/botstrap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug-report.md&title=)
  (for minor or non-sensitive issues, or in addition to a private email)

Please use your best judgment, and thank you for helping keep our users safe!
